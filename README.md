Design of memory-efficient OpenMP-based Parallel [Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA)], aka RAK, for [community detection].

Community detection in graphs identifies groups of nodes that are more densely connected within the groups than between them. While many studies focus on enhancing detection performance, managing memory becomes critical for processing large graphs on shared-memory systems. Recently, we developed efficient implementations of the LPA, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection, though these methods incur high memory costs due to collision-free per-thread hashtables. To mitigate this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives based on weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables and significantly reduce memory usage in LPA, Leiden, and LPA implementations. This approach achieves only a minor quality reduction (up to 1%) with moderate runtime penalties. We believe these slightly slower but memory-efficient methods are well-suited for parallel processing and could offer better performance than current memory-intensive techniques on systems with numerous threads.

Below we plot the time taken by [Default LPA], weighted Boyer-Moore (BM) based LPA, and weighted Misra-Gries (MG) based LPA with `k=8` slots, on 13 different graphs. MG8 LPA is, on average, `2.11x` slower than Default LPA, but requires significantly less memory (i.e., just `64 bytes` per thread).

Next, we plot the modularity of communities identified by Default LPA, BM Leiden, and MG8 LPA. MG8 LPA, on average, achieves a modularity within `1%` of Default LPA - and is thus a viable memory-efficient alternative to the Default LPA. Higher values of `k` can be chosen for even better modularity, if needed.
